changes:
  - balance: "Nerfs disposals damage so that it has a 20% chance to apply instead of an 80% chance to apply. You no longer take disposals damage if you're in hard crit or dead. You take 1 less disposals damage when it applies, now, a total of 4 per turn"
  - bugfix: "Improves disposals code so it actually deals damage to you on direction changes."
